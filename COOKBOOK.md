# Codex Review Gate Cookbook

Languages: [British English (en-GB)](COOKBOOK.md) | [简体中文 (zh-CN)](COOKBOOK.zh-CN.md)

## Normal Path

Use this path after the workflow is merged to the repository default branch and `codex/review-gate` is required by the ruleset.

For the v1.5 rollout, do not activate the reusable caller in the source root or
template. The immutable v1.5.0 release exists, but its live canary exposed an
incorrect commit-versus-tag-object admission contract. Consumers fail closed on
v1.5.0; there is no digest-keyed erratum. Activation remains a
separate follow-up PR after the compatible v1.5.1 repair/provenance asset, both
`v1.5` and `v1` aliases, and a replacement live canary are verified.

1. Open or update a ready PR.
2. The workflow writes `codex/review-gate = pending` and posts a controlled `@codex review` marker.
3. Wait for Codex to respond.
4. On the next complete run, the gate re-reads the PR, head, and complete
   evidence and writes `success` only when the stable reduction selects an
   official trusted clean artifact strongly bound to the current head and no
   current-head or ancestor finding remains blocking.
5. If a confirmed current-head or ancestor finding remains, the gate writes
   `failure`. A simultaneous evidence issue is included in the failure summary;
   `error` is used only when no confirmed blocking finding exists.

For the clearest request flow, repositories may disable Codex automatic
review-on-push to reduce duplicate reviews. Automatic and controlled-marker
results are evaluated by the same provider-evidence rules; the marker does not
authorise either result.

`success` means only that this required commit status passed. It does not
attest a named triple review or the PR's overall merge readiness.
The authoritative machine-readable reducer policy is
[`decision-table.json`](decision-table.json), `policy_major: 1` and
`policy_version: 1.4.0`.

Commit Status is per repository SHA/context, not per PR. Multiple open PRs
with the same head share the status and branch-protection signal, so the status
itself cannot prove PR isolation.

## Verify Action Provenance

Use this path when a review or readiness Skill needs to rely on the gate. Let
`W` be `job.workflow_sha`, the matching exact-attempt
`referenced_workflows[].sha`, and receipt `producer.action.ref`; let `C` be the
checkout output commit, receipt `producer.action.commit_sha`, and provenance
`action.commit_oid`; and let `T` be the independently signed
`tags.v1.tag_object_oid`. Keep four SHA domains separate: caller workflow
definition (`github.workflow_sha`), exact API run-attempt head (`head_sha`),
called workflow selected object identity (`job.workflow_sha`), and current
PR/status head. Never require
the run-attempt `head_sha` or Artifact API `workflow_run.head_sha` to equal the
selected receipt status head; the run-attempt head to equal
`GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SHA`; or `GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SHA` to equal `job.workflow_sha`.
The caller workflow SHA identifies the caller workflow revision. The
authoritative machine-readable contract is `producer_receipt_boundary` in
[`decision-table.json`](decision-table.json):

1. Select the structural mode before validation. After activation, canonical
   GitHub.com reusable mode requires
   `jobs.<job>.uses: JoeyTeng/codex-review-gate-action/.github/workflows/codex-review-gate.yml@v1`.
   Its called job fixes `runs-on: ubuntu-slim`; caller repository variables
   cannot substitute a self-hosted runner. Treat that GitHub-hosted runner as a
   runtime trust root for checkout/worktree/receipt production, not a
   cryptographic attestation. Direct composite mode retains caller-owned runner
   configuration.
   Reusable receipt attribution also requires an independently trusted caller
   workflow revision and complete job graph. A same-run malicious sibling can
   race to create the attempt-named artifact and write a matching status.
   Exact-attempt `referenced_workflows` is run-level only and binds no job,
   callsite, or receipt. Causal consistency therefore holds only inside the
   trusted-caller plus fixed-hosted-runner boundary, not as job-scoped
   cryptographic attribution.
   Floating `@v1` is the intentional centralised pre-execution trust boundary,
   not post-run immutable provenance. Direct mode instead requires
   `JoeyTeng/codex-review-gate-action@<exact-lower-case-40-sha>` and is the
   GitHub Enterprise Server fallback. Never downgrade failed reusable evidence
   to direct mode.
   Runtime mode selection gives native action context structural priority: if
   either native action repository/ref field is present, direct identity is
   recorded and the reusable checkout-commit binding is ignored. Reusable W/C
   binding applies only when both native fields are absent and the job tuple is
   exact canonical.
   This receipt-backed positive verification path is GitHub.com-only. GHES
   direct fallback can run the gate, but it cannot supply that admission
   decision.
2. For the exact run and attempt-specific name
   `codex-review-gate-producer-receipt-<run_id>-<attempt>`, query the Artifact
   API and require `total_count == 1`. A missing, expired, deleted, duplicate,
   or upload-failed artifact is a fail-closed result. This is a consumer
   inventory guarantee; the producer only makes one action-level,
   `overwrite: false` upload attempt for a finalized run attempt.
3. When outputs are available, match the REST artifact ID to the output ID.
   Construct
   `<server>/<repository>/actions/runs/<run_id>/artifacts/<artifact_id>` and
   match that web URL to the output; do not compare the REST artifact `.url`,
   which is an API URL. Require REST `.digest` to equal `sha256:` plus the raw
   64-hex output digest. Download the artifact, verify its digest, and require
   exactly one file named `codex-review-gate-producer-receipt.json`. Validate
   it against `producer-receipt.schema.json` at the root of the dynamically
   admitted peeled action commit or directly pinned action commit; its path in this
   source repository is
   `packages/action/producer-receipt.schema.json`. Although the schema permits
   finalized `completed` and `failed` receipts, this positive path requires
   `execution.result == completed`; a `failed` receipt is audit-only for a
   positive decision.
4. Require GitHub.com, exact run/attempt/attempt-specific target URL, current
   repository, all expected caller/workflow/job fields, and
   `execution.result == completed`. Reusable mode requires the exact canonical
   `job.workflow_*` tuple and action repository,
   `producer.action.ref == job.workflow_sha`, the checkout commit bound through
   `CODEX_REVIEW_GATE_CHECKED_OUT_ACTION_COMMIT_SHA` in
   `producer.action.commit_sha`, and `immutable: true`; direct mode
   requires the expected action repository and lower-case 40-SHA with action
   ref and commit SHA equal and `immutable: true`.
5. Fetch the attempt with
   `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run_id}/attempts/{attempt}`. Its
   response `url` and `html_url` remain base-run resource URLs. Match the
   Artifact API `workflow_run.id/head_sha` to the exact attempt response's
   `id/head_sha`. In reusable mode, require the optional, nullable
   `referenced_workflows` array to exist and contain exactly one matching
   canonical repository/workflow-path and v1-call entry. Require its `sha` to
   equal `W` and its `ref` to equal `refs/tags/v1`. Require `W` to equal exactly
   one declared value in
   `runtime_closure.called_workflow.workflow_sha_resolution.candidates`, with
   each candidate equal to its declared field. Admit only current-live `W == T`
   (`T == tags.v1.tag_object_oid`) or future `W == C` (`C ==
   action.commit_oid`). In both branches require independently signed `T` to
   peel directly to `C`, and require `tags.v1.peeled_commit_oid ==
   action.commit_oid == producer.action.commit_sha`. Other object types, nested
   tag peels, and zero or multiple candidate matches fail closed. This is run-level corroboration only,
   not a job/receipt mapping or cryptographic binding.
6. In reusable mode, enumerate release candidates through the fully paginated GitHub Releases
   API and require exactly one published, immutable, non-draft,
   non-prerelease `v1.x.y` release whose trusted-signer tag peels to `C`, whose
   single complete schema-v2 provenance asset has compatible closed
   schema/majors and `action.commit_oid == C`, and whose candidate set contains
   `W` exactly once. Zero or multiple matching releases/assets fail closed.
   Require independently signed annotated `v1` tag object `T` to peel directly
   to `C`, including for future `W == C`. Require the repository
   immutable-release setting to be enabled. Verify both tag signatures and the
   trusted signer fingerprint, action root tree and critical-file bindings,
   receipt schema v1, and compatible `policy_major == 1`. Never infer a historical run
   from the current `v1` target.
7. Within the current-PR/status head domain, REST-list all Commit Status
   records with the request `ref` equal to the exact current PR head; the
   selected status must come from that exact-head response. Select the
   case-insensitive logical context's latest record, then require the exact
   configured context spelling (`codex/review-gate` by default) and creator
   `github-actions[bot]` with type `Bot`. Select the unique matching receipt
   `statuses[]` member for the current PR—not necessarily the last member—and
   require its `head_sha` to equal the exact current PR head. Require the same
   PR number, ID, node ID, context, state, target URL, and creator. A positive
   decision requires exact
   `status.state == success` for the selected REST record and receipt member.
   The selected member's creator must independently be exact
   `github-actions[bot]` with type `Bot`. Missing or non-unique membership
   fails closed.
8. Re-read that node as a GraphQL `StatusContext` and independently confirm the
   same exact context, state, and target URL. Require
   `StatusContext.commit.oid` to equal the exact current PR head and therefore
   the selected receipt status `head_sha`. Its creator must independently be
   exactly `github-actions[bot]` with type `Bot`; creator agreement alone is
   insufficient. All four SHA domains may legitimately differ; never invent
   equality between them.
9. Independently reload and reduce official provider evidence for the same PR
   named by the selected receipt member. Receipt v1 is causal producer evidence
   only; it does not prove clean evidence or replace provider reduction.
10. Immediately before readiness consumes the result, final-REST-list the
   exact-head statuses. The case-insensitive logical latest must remain the
   same REST ID/node ID with the exact context. Stably re-read PR
   head/lifecycle, exact run-attempt metadata, and the run-level artifact
   inventory queried with the attempt-specific name, which must still contain
   exactly one artifact; every
   binding and the independent provider reduction must remain stable. Changes
   receive bounded retry and then fail closed.

Canonical reusable callers accept compatible v1.x Action-only upgrades without
a caller or Skill change; direct callers must update their exact pin. A
protocol or policy major change requires a coordinated Skill update. Signature
and release checks are point-in-time evidence, not a guarantee of historical or
future revocation freshness; enforce a separate policy when that guarantee is
required.

The status POST and artifact upload are not atomic, and artifacts can expire or
be deleted. Receipt v1 and its digest are not a cryptographic signature, OIDC
attestation, or content-addressed storage guarantee. Any unavailable or invalid
link in this chain fails closed. Exact creator checks remain spoofable with
`statuses: write`; only the validated receipt/run chain adds causal
consistency. These point-in-time checks do not eliminate TOCTOU or turn a
per-SHA/context status into PR-specific proof.

## Failed Findings Recovery

Use this path when `codex/review-gate` is `failure` with `failed_findings`.

1. Address the current-head or ancestor finding in code, or decide that it is
   not actionable.
2. For an exact joined review thread, resolve that thread in GitHub. Only its
   authoritative `isResolved` value being exactly `true` closes the finding;
   `isOutdated` and a later clean result do not.
3. Make sure a strongly bound official clean artifact exists for the current
   head. A clean issue comment needs exactly one `Reviewed commit` marker. A
   pull request review binds through its native full `commit_id`, and any body
   hash must agree. If no clean exists, posting `@codex review` is the clearest
   way to request one.
4. Let a Codex comment or review event wake the gate, or run the workflow
   manually for the PR.
5. The gate rebuilds and finally re-reads the complete evidence snapshot. It
   writes `success` only when the PR, head, complete evidence, and reduction
   remain stable and no blocking finding remains.

An older threadless same-head or ancestor finding is superseded only by the
strictly later selected current-head clean. A finding proven to be on a
non-ancestor is retained for audit, removed from the blocking set, and the
evidence is reduced again. If ancestry remains unknown after bounded retries,
the stable result is `error` with `ancestry-unverified`.

For issue comments, `updated_at` is the validated revision time. Two issue
comments in the same revision second are always ambiguous and fail closed;
`created_at == updated_at` cannot prove no same-second edit, so IDs never break
that tie. Same-time pull-request reviews may use the larger canonical ID only
within the review channel; cross-channel ties remain ambiguous.

This recovery path is event-driven. It does not add polling or scheduled runner minutes.

A marker deadline, closed marker state, baseline, or recovery cutoff cannot
reject an otherwise valid provider artifact. A clean artifact that arrives
after a marker deadline can pass on a later complete run.

## Waiting and Evidence Errors

- A valid `Codex Review in progress` or `still in progress` artifact keeps the
  gate pending under the existing marker and deadline. It does not acknowledge
  the marker, reset or extend a deadline, or cause a repost.
- `eyes` may move `waiting_ack` to `waiting_result` without extending a
  deadline. `+1` is audit-only and has no verdict authority.
- The unchanged defaults are 300 seconds for initial acknowledgement, 1,800
  seconds for maximum acknowledgement backoff, 3,600 seconds for an
  acknowledged result, and 7,200 seconds overall.
- Transient acquisition or reconciliation faults receive bounded retries and
  then write stable `error`. Deterministically malformed evidence also writes
  `error`. If a confirmed finding and an evidence error coexist, the result is
  `failure` and the summary mentions the evidence issue.

## Deprecated Recovery Controls

The v1 inputs remain available so existing workflows and stored state continue
to load:

```yaml
with:
  failed-findings-recovery: ${{ vars.CODEX_REVIEW_GATE_FAILED_FINDINGS_RECOVERY }}
  failed-findings-recovery-mode: ${{ vars.CODEX_REVIEW_GATE_FAILED_FINDINGS_RECOVERY_MODE }}
```

`failed-findings-recovery`, `failed-findings-recovery-mode`, and their
repository-variable or environment equivalents are deprecated compatibility
controls. The action continues to accept and validate their v1 values, but
those values no longer change gate decisions or request orchestration. Legacy
fields already present in sticky state remain audit data. In particular,
`head`, `fresh`, a disabled recovery switch, and a recorded recovery cutoff
cannot make the latest valid current-head clean result pass or fail.

## Manual Recovery

Use `workflow_dispatch` when no provider event wakes the workflow or when an
operator wants to re-evaluate one PR explicitly.

1. Open the `Codex Review Gate` workflow.
2. Run it manually with the PR number.
3. The gate reloads current GitHub evidence and computes the result from the
   complete snapshot. Stored sticky state is used only to resume request
   orchestration.

Manual recovery remains fail-closed: unstable or incomplete evidence cannot
pass. A confirmed current-head or ancestor finding remains `failure`; absent a
confirmed finding, evidence that cannot be acquired or reconciled after
bounded retries becomes `error`. Marker or recovery history does not veto an
otherwise valid stable current-head clean artifact.
