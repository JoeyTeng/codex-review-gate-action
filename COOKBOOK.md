# Codex Review Gate v2 Cookbook

Languages: [British English (en-GB)](COOKBOOK.md) | [简体中文 (zh-CN)](COOKBOOK.zh-CN.md)

This cookbook starts after the complete canonical verifier and controller
[workflow bundle](https://github.com/Joey-Tools/codex-review-gate/tree/master/templates/codex-gated-repo/.github/workflows),
the managed `.github/CODEOWNERS` control plane, and the disabled
[ruleset template](https://github.com/Joey-Tools/codex-review-gate/blob/master/templates/codex-gated-repo/rulesets/codex-review-gate.json)
have been installed. For installation and canary activation, use the
[human-readable guide](https://github.com/Joey-Tools/codex-review-gate/blob/master/docs/install/human.md)
or let an agent follow the
[agent-executable guide](https://github.com/Joey-Tools/codex-review-gate/blob/master/docs/install/agent.md).

## Command variables

The examples use:

```bash
REPO="OWNER/REPO"
PR_NUMBER="123"
WORKFLOW="codex-review-gate-controller.yml"
```

Read the exact current head immediately before each dispatch:

```bash
HEAD_SHA="$(gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" \
  --repo "github.com/$REPO" \
  --json headRefOid --jq .headRefOid)"
```

Do not reuse that value after a push, update-branch operation, base change,
close/reopen transition or any uncertainty about PR state.

Each dispatch handles one PR. To recover several PRs, invoke separate runs with
each PR's independently read head.

## Choose the path

### Ordinary low-cost review

When the exact head is not already carrying a success that must be invalidated,
the normal agent path below is available only for the first physical generation
of a PR with no base epoch. Before posting, verify that the current lineage has
no earlier provider-triggerable request-shaped boundary that is not explicitly
bound to another full head:

1. read the open PR and exact current head;
2. post a comment whose complete visible content is exact `@codex review`;
3. let Codex publish its evidence without occupying an Actions runner;
4. dispatch `reconcile` for that exact head; and
5. follow the summary until the final exact-head merge closure passes.

Prefer the GitHub CLI pull-request comment command with a task-scoped body file
so shell quoting cannot add visible text. Do not construct the workflow-owned
hidden marker by hand; the `begin-review` operation owns that form.

Before posting, prove that no `begin-review` run with `request_review=true` is
active for the exact head and that it has not already emitted a canonical
marker. Direct and controller request producers are mutually exclusive for one
head generation. If ownership is uncertain, inspect the controller run,
canonical marker, sticky diagnostic, and provider evidence instead of sending
another request.

An ordinary request author's default minimum permission is `write`, `maintain`
or `admin`, unless protected default-branch configuration deliberately selects
`any`.

### Workflow-coordinated review

Use `begin-review` when the controller must own the
request, including a deliberate same-head re-review after an earlier success:

```bash
gh workflow run "$WORKFLOW" \
  --repo "github.com/$REPO" \
  -f operation=begin-review \
  -f pr_number="$PR_NUMBER" \
  -f expected_head_sha="$HEAD_SHA" \
  -f request_review=true
```

Observe that exact controller run establish and read back the strictly newer
verifier attempt before relying on it. The same-PR controller concurrency group
uses `cancel-in-progress: false`, but concurrency is not a mutation fence.

The advanced form:

```bash
gh workflow run "$WORKFLOW" \
  --repo "github.com/$REPO" \
  -f operation=begin-review \
  -f pr_number="$PR_NUMBER" \
  -f expected_head_sha="$HEAD_SHA" \
  -f request_review=false
```

does not post. It is best effort and adds no dedicated barrier. Post the new
exact `@codex review` only after the exact controller run completes.

Do not overlap the two producers. An unclosed request followed by another
request creates a lineage gap because terminal Codex text has no originating
request ID. V2 intentionally remains pending; evidence arriving outside the
original predecessor-to-successor window cannot repair its ordering. A new
head is sufficient only when every ambiguous predecessor is canonically bound
to a different full head. If any predecessor is ordinary, edited, malformed,
denied, deleted, or otherwise unbound, a commit change cannot prove that its
provider flight ended. Open a replacement PR from the intended branch/commits, run one
canonical producer there, and close the ambiguous PR after the replacement is
validated.

### Reconcile one exact head

After Codex evidence arrives, or whenever a recovery instruction says to
reconcile:

```bash
gh workflow run "$WORKFLOW" \
  --repo "github.com/$REPO" \
  -f operation=reconcile \
  -f request_review=false \
  -f pr_number="$PR_NUMBER" \
  -f expected_head_sha="$HEAD_SHA"
```

`request_comment_id` may be supplied as a locator hint when the summary or
provider event identifies the relevant request. It never supplies a verdict or
permits a partial negative-evidence scan:

```bash
gh workflow run "$WORKFLOW" \
  --repo "github.com/$REPO" \
  -f operation=reconcile \
  -f request_review=false \
  -f pr_number="$PR_NUMBER" \
  -f expected_head_sha="$HEAD_SHA" \
  -f request_comment_id="$REQUEST_COMMENT_ID"
```

Never pass `--ref`, use `repository_dispatch`, or supply ad-hoc numeric limit
inputs. Omitting the ref selects the protected default-branch workflow. Read
the created run back and reject it unless its `headBranch` is the current
default branch.

## Ordinary agent loop

1. Prove the target is an open, non-draft, same-repository PR to the default
   branch and read its exact head.
2. If a new review generation is needed, choose direct exact
   `@codex review` or `begin-review` as described above.
3. Wait for Codex. Do not create a cron or repeated blind request loop.
4. Dispatch `reconcile` for the exact head.
5. Read the four Action outputs and the Actions summary:
   `execution_health`, `gate_outcome`, `recovery_code`, `retry_safe`.
6. Always follow the one concrete `recovery_code` action in the summary. Only
   `wait_provider` is a pure wait. Do not infer clean from zero counts, a
   pending result or a sticky comment.
7. When the result reaches `healthy/success`, perform the exact-head merge
   closure below immediately before merge.

If the head changes at any step, stop. Read the new current head, summary and
complete physical lineage; do not automatically begin a same-PR generation. A
stale run never follows or writes its decision to the new head. Continue on the
new head only when every ambiguous predecessor is explicitly bound to a
different full head. An unclosable ordinary, edited, malformed, denied,
deleted, or otherwise unbound predecessor requires a replacement PR.

## Interpret results

| Result | Meaning | Operator action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `healthy/success` | Stable complete current-head clean evidence was proved. | Perform the final verifier/head/ruleset reread; merge only if all still match. |
| `healthy/failure` | Qualifying findings were proved. | Follow the summary reason and finding links. Fix and reconcile on the original PR only when lineage remains recoverable; an unclosable historical lineage requires a replacement PR carrying the fixes and one canonical generation. |
| `unhealthy/failure` | Findings were proved but execution or final result handling also failed. | Keep the findings blocking, repair the named execution boundary and reconcile. |
| `healthy/pending` | Evaluation completed safely, but current state cannot authorise success yet. | Follow `recovery_code`; wait without another action only for `wait_provider`. |
| `unhealthy/pending` | API, pagination, cap or stability execution is incomplete. | Follow the recovery code; do not treat it as no findings. |
| `healthy/not_applicable` | A delayed automatic event no longer applies. | Usually no action; reconcile the current head if a gate decision is still needed. |
| `unhealthy/not_applicable` | The manual target is invalid or unsupported. | Correct the target or use a supported scope; do not bypass the ruleset. |
| `unhealthy/unknown` | No trusted state could be read. | Repair access/execution, reread the PR, then use the summary's recovery action. |

Every pending result remains blocking; `healthy/pending` is not a weak
success.

`unhealthy/success` is never legal. `healthy/pending` is not a weak success. A
workflow failure describes evaluator health, not a Codex finding. A normal run
with `gate_outcome=failure` means the evaluator worked and the merge must
remain blocked.

Require the unique canonical verifier run/job/CheckRun recorded against the
exact current PR feature-head SHA. The verifier still executes on
`refs/pull/N/merge`; strict
`GITHUB_REF`/`GITHUB_SHA`, event-scope and fresh-PR checks bind its success to
the unchanged current head, base and test-merge. For activation, also require
the canonical run-name receipt
`codex-review-gate-verifier/<PR>/<current test-merge SHA>` in `display_title`
and the run's sole PR binding to carry the current feature head and
default-branch base SHA. A controller CheckRun binds the default-branch commit
and is not the required signal. The controller must observe a strictly newer
verifier attempt and its unique job/CheckRun; ambiguous rerun state stays
blocking. Commit-status projection and the status-POST recovery path have been
removed.

`retry_safe=true` means an immediate rerun with identical inputs is a valid
recovery action. It does not mean success is likely or that the runtime may
skip evidence. When false, first perform the head refresh, permission repair,
provider wait or finding change named by `recovery_code`.

## Recovery codes

| Code | Safe next action |
| --- | --- |
| `none` | No evaluator recovery is required; perform exact-head merge closure. |
| `wait_provider` | Wait for Codex to publish terminal evidence; do not spam requests. |
| `reconcile` | Reread the exact current head and run one scoped reconcile. |
| `fix_findings` | Follow the summary reason. Normally fix the reported current findings, separately resolve inline conversations, obtain later head-bound clean evidence, then reconcile. If the reason also reports an unclosable historical lineage, put the fixes on a replacement PR and run exactly one canonical generation there instead of requesting again on the original PR. |
| `request_clean_generation` | Follow the summary reason and lineage. For a recoverable latest/current canonical request, stay on the original PR: obtain the required direct `+1` on the named request, or create exactly one newer canonical generation only when the reason says one is still needed. A historical gap may reset on a legitimate new head only when every ambiguous predecessor is explicitly bound to another full head. If any ordinary, edited, malformed, denied, deleted, or otherwise unbound predecessor makes that gap unclosable, do not request again on that PR/head; open a replacement PR and run one canonical generation there. |
| `retry_reconcile` | Retry the same exact-head reconcile when `retry_safe` permits it. |
| `wait_then_reconcile` | Let GitHub/Codex settle, reread the head, then reconcile. |
| `use_expanded_limits` | Set protected repository variable `CODEX_REVIEW_GATE_LIMITS_PROFILE=expanded`, then reconcile the same exact head. |
| `raise_protected_limit` | The reviewed profiles are insufficient; change the protected product/configuration limit through ordinary review rather than supplying an ad-hoc number. |
| `refresh_head` | Read the authoritative current head and start a fresh operation; never make the stale run follow it. |
| `repair_permissions` | Restore both canonical workflow permission boundaries or the named access boundary, then reconcile. |
| `retry_begin` | Not immediately retry-safe: wait for the exact same-run marker to settle, then rerun the original workflow run only if it remains absent; do not dispatch a new generation or blindly post duplicates. |
| `unsupported_target` | Move to a documented supported scope or leave the gate blocked. |
| `create_verifier_run` | If ready, convert the PR to draft and mark it ready again; if already draft, mark it ready. Verify a new `ready_for_review` verifier for the exact current head/base/test-merge scope, then reconcile. |

The summary is authoritative for the concrete reason, lineage and object links
within the code category. The recovery code alone does not authorise another
request. In particular, an existing latest/current canonical request that only
lacks attributable clean needs its qualifying direct `+1`, not another
generation boundary. An unclosable historical unbound predecessor gap needs a
replacement PR, not a same-PR request or a commit-only reset.

## Finding accounting and supersession

When derivable without another evidence query, the summary and best-effort
sticky report:

- `findings_unresolved` — admitted current unresolved non-inline findings;
- `findings_resolved` — admitted resolved findings in the reducer model;
- `findings_historical` — superseded or otherwise historical findings retained
  for audit;
- `findings_indeterminate` — findings whose current classification cannot be
  safely resolved.

An incomplete API read, page set or capped scan makes affected values
`unknown`, never zero. Counts are diagnostic only. Inline conversations are
not counted; the ruleset's “all conversations resolved” requirement owns them.

Any qualifying current-head non-inline finding blocks immediately. It is not a
permanent lease: on the same head it may be superseded, but only by a strictly
newer authorised `@codex review` generation followed by clean bound to that
generation and head. An unrelated later clean, an edited request or ambiguous
ordering cannot erase it.

If the finding is real, fix it and use `fix_findings`; when its reason also
reports an unclosable historical lineage, carry the fixes to a replacement PR
and do not request another generation on the original PR. If the code does not
need to change but the finding is obsolete or inapplicable, follow the
`request_clean_generation` summary reason. Request or complete the
latest/current canonical clean on the original PR only when its lineage remains
recoverable. If the reason instead identifies an unclosable historical unbound
predecessor gap, use a replacement PR. Reconcile after the later provider
result; resolving an inline conversation alone does not change reducer state.

Terminal clean text and a qualifying provider `+1` carry equal clean authority
only for the first physical generation in a no-base-epoch, single-flight
lineage. If a second physical request exists, provider terminal evidence may
close only the first gap; every later gap and the newer generation's positive
or superseding authority require a qualifying `+1` directly on the relevant
request. A delayed or duplicate unbound terminal remains pending. With an
observed base epoch, request-bound `+1` evidence is required for every gap and
for the latest generation.

Ordinary request reactions are liveness signals only; ordinary `+1` cannot
head-bind clean. Same-time/later official `eyes`/progress from Codex prevents
candidate clean from completing. Reaction-only changes do not start an
automatic run; use a later provider event or manual reconcile to observe them.
Every unbound progress carrier remains liveness; nearby request boundaries
cannot prove its head. An edited terminal additionally carries unbound unknown
activity from creation through terminal revision. Its terminal endpoint is a
self-veto exception only for that same carrier.

## Stable-snapshot recovery

Only a clean candidate pays for two independent, fully paginated GitHub reads
five seconds apart. A same-head request, edit, reaction or other
decision-relevant change restarts the pair. A changed head or lifecycle makes
the run stale. API, pagination and cap failures make the read incomplete.

If the stability budget ends before two matching clean snapshots, expect
`unhealthy/pending` with `wait_then_reconcile`:

1. stop changing PR/provider evidence;
2. let GitHub and Codex settle;
3. reread the exact current head; and
4. dispatch one scoped reconcile.

Do not delete provider evidence, weaken the required status or treat an
unstable read as clean.

## Large PRs and profiles

Start with the protected repository default profile. If the summary reports
`use_expanded_limits`, set the reviewed profile as a repository variable
without modifying either canonical workflow:

```bash
gh variable set CODEX_REVIEW_GATE_LIMITS_PROFILE \
  --repo "github.com/$REPO" \
  --body expanded
```

Then reread the exact head and run one scoped controller `reconcile`. The
manual dispatch deliberately has no `limits_profile` input.

Do not edit the canonical wrapper, and do not add temporary `max_pages`,
`max_objects` or other numeric dispatch inputs. If even `expanded` is
insufficient, follow `raise_protected_limit` and change the protected limit
through the product's ordinary review/release path.

## Short-SHA evidence

Provider terminal evidence may name a short reviewed SHA. Runtime asks GitHub
to resolve it within the relevant PR scope:

- one unambiguous match equal to current head can bind the evidence;
- no match remains unbound;
- multiple matches are indeterminate and cannot pass; and
- a pull-request review must also have native `commit_id` equal to the resolved
  current head.

Do not edit provider evidence merely to expand a prefix. If it is ambiguous or
bound to another commit, follow the summary reason and lineage. Complete an
existing current canonical request with its direct `+1`, or create exactly one
generation only when the lineage remains recoverable and the summary says one
is needed. An unclosable historical unbound gap requires a replacement PR, not
another same-PR boundary.

## Sticky diagnostic recovery

The sticky is a best-effort report, not a receipt. Runtime uses create-once
semantics: immediately before any write it reads the complete issue-comment
inventory and posts one canonical diagnostic only when none exists. It never
patches an existing canonical diagnostic and never posts a replacement while
one exists. Multiple canonical diagnostics are left untouched and diagnosed
with a bounded warning.

Only an exact, unedited, official canonical sticky is exempt from physical
request lineage. An edited, invalid, forged or wrong-provenance marker-looking
comment fails closed as an unbound physical-only boundary. A non-qualifying
duplicate is not harmless merely because another canonical sticky exists; it
can make historical lineage unclosable and require a replacement PR.

If the sticky is missing or stale, its write failed, or duplicates exist:

1. leave provider evidence intact;
2. reread the current head;
3. run one exact-head reconcile; and
4. trust the new verifier CheckRun and summary reconstructed from GitHub, then
   follow its reason and lineage. Do not edit or delete sticky comments to
   repair the result; use a replacement PR when the reported boundary cannot
   close.

Sticky write failure does not clear findings. Reconcile does not update or
replace an existing canonical diagnostic; the verifier CheckRun and summary are
the authoritative current result.

## Exact-head merge closure

Immediately before merge:

1. reread the PR's current head;
2. dispatch controller `reconcile` with that exact SHA;
3. observe the strictly newer verifier attempt and its unique canonical
   `codex/github-review-gate` CheckRun on the current feature-head SHA, with
   that verifier run bound to the current test-merge;
4. require `execution_health=healthy`, `gate_outcome=success` and a successful
   verifier conclusion;
5. reread unchanged PR head, base and test-merge SHA;
6. require branch up to date and all conversations resolved; and
7. require the ruleset to allow the intended merge.

If the head or any gate changes, do not merge; repeat the closure for the new
state. Otherwise merge immediately with this exact-head compare-and-swap:

```bash
gh pr merge "$PR_NUMBER" \
  --repo "github.com/$REPO" \
  --match-head-commit "$HEAD_SHA"
```

Stable snapshots do not lock the PR after the run; direct human UI merge
outside this closure is unsupported.

## Migrating from v1

Use one migration PR to remove the v1 caller and install both canonical v2
workflows plus managed CODEOWNERS. Keep every inventoried legacy requirement
active through the migration merge. Bind the canonical read-only legacy inventory SHA-256 in
the owner approval snapshot, then require a fresh strict inventory with that
same external digest. It binds repository/default branch, each matching
ruleset's complete identity, source, enforcement, target, conditions,
`bypass_actors`, `rules`, and effective `required_status_checks` rule, plus the
complete classic required-status object including every producer `app_id`.
Even an empty legacy inventory has a repository/branch-bound digest;
incomplete API/schema data or any drift fails closed. Then require the owner as
current actor, the owner's latest exact-head approval and the synchronous
exact-SHA merge. Immediately reread the current
default and require merged lifecycle, base, and head to remain the exact
approved scope. A failed readback keeps all legacy requirements active; only
success permits Disabled staging to begin while legacy remains active.
Do not treat approval plus a head reread
as sufficient, and do not replace v1 with only a bare `uses: ...@v2` step.

After the installation PR merges:

1. keep every inventoried legacy requirement active;
2. stage a separate supplied v2 ruleset as Disabled with no bypass actors;
3. open a separate harmless canary PR while legacy still blocks merges;
4. exercise the ordinary `@v2` review/reconcile path;
5. verify the exact canonical verifier run, native feature-head CheckRun bound
   to the unchanged head/base/test-merge scope,
   freshness and conversation enforcement with no same-name collision;
6. activate the validated ruleset and read the exact complete Active policy
   back;
7. through step 6, pass the same owner-approved digest explicitly to every
   stage/activation preview and apply, even though those helper invocations are
   separate processes;
8. only then run read-only `--derive-post-cleanup-plan` against the complete
   pre-cleanup security snapshot, passing the same external owner-approved
   legacy-inventory digest as `--expected-legacy-inventory-sha256` and requiring
   the current pre-state to match it;
   review its canonical plan, which may remove
   only `codex/review-gate`; an emptied status rule may be removed and a whole
   dedicated legacy-only ruleset only when no other rule remains; an emptied
   classic required-status policy may also disappear; require exact
   preservation of repository/default head, workflow/CODEOWNERS inventory,
   owner permission, all fields/non-legacy checks including `strict`/`app_id`
   in a surviving classic policy, and every retained ruleset's identity,
   conditions, bypass actors, and unrelated rules; record its
   `expected_post_cleanup_security_sha256`;
9. perform the separately authorised legacy cleanup, then run read-only
   `--verify-post-cleanup --expected-post-cleanup-security-sha256 <digest>`;
   require two identical complete security rounds that both match the external
   digest, show both legacy surfaces clear and show the same complete v2 policy
   Active; and
10. close the canary PR without merging, verify its recorded head
    repository/ref/OID, and lease-delete only that still-exact temporary ref.

If the canary fails, repair through ordinary forward Git history. Do not move
the `v2` release alias backwards and do not weaken the ruleset to manufacture a
pass. Once v2 has been written Active, an inconclusive cleanup or verification
also leaves it Active: use read-only diagnostics and never disable or roll it
back in response.
